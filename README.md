## Game design

This game is simple: you have to achieve the highest score without dying.

### Player
You will control an android whose task will be end with the ghost tenants. For this purpose you'll have a gun that shoots yellow balls.

You'll have to hit them a couple of times before they dissapear (the remaining health will be displayed on top of the enemy as a red progress bar)

### Enemies
The enemies are ghosts, 

![alt Ghost minding its business](https://github.com/mirlop01/Unreal-project/blob/master/Content/House/Images/Ghost.png)

they will be running on their own until they see you, and at this point two things can happen:

- If you have the weapon -> They will try to steal it from you.
- If you don't have it -> You better run, they will try to kill you.

If any of the ghosts has stolen your weapon it will glow with a yellow light and will run away from you, but remember, the other ghosts will still be trying to kill you!

**Pickups**
You have some pickups spawners in order to recover health

or ammo.

It will be automatically and randomly generated after being taken.

### Levels
You will **level up** everytime you kill all the enemies on the manor. 
As you level up, more ghosts will spawn.

## Game development
This game has been design and created in Unreal engine.
The Scenery was created using the starter content meshes that are provided by the First Person Shooter Example.

The mechanics were developed using blueprints.

### Enemies
The enemies behaviour were developed using basic AI. For this we used a [behaviour tree](https://github.com/mirlop01/Unreal-project/tree/master/Content/Blueprints/Enemy).
